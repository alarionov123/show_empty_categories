This is the add-on developed for CS-Cart. This add-on allows you to automatically manage the display of categories on the storefront, based on the presence of products within them. The add-on allows you to hide categories with no current products, and reactivate them if they were previously hidden with this add-on.

When syncing categories from the add-on settings, categories without products are filtered and then hidden from the storefront. If products appear in hidden categories, they are automatically enabled the next time you synchronize.
